Megahertz is a monthly meetup for all woman who are interested in technology.

!!!include(_meeting_en.md)!!!

We want to create a space that allows us to code, hack stuff, learn, solder, do anything and everything that relates to technology.
We are welcome to anyone who identifies as a woman; regardless of
skill. Just visit us.

**Unfortunaly we are mostly german speakers, so we have a hard time accomodating english speakers without specifically preparing for it.Please DO NOT HESITATE to email us if you are not an avid german speaker, we will be able to arrange something for you!**
