Once a month, the CCC Hannover is reserved for us. We meet there at 7PM on the second Thursday each month.
([Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/28166185#map=19/52.38811/9.71793); take the elevator to the third level).

Some of our meetings are internal (for women and those how identify as non binary or genderqueer)
and some are open to all creatures.
We announce for each meeting whether it is open for all or intern only.
